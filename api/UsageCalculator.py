        Assumption:
            If usage is less than one day, then it is counted as one day.
            
        Purpose of SQL:
            Given usage account Id, find out the usage amount of a product in a period of days

        Field returned by SQL:
            product/ProductName
            UsageAmount of a period
            date(startdate)
            days: the number of days between "lineItem/UsageStartDate" and "lineItem/UsageEndDate" (exclusive)
            
        Left for python program:        
            Date structure:
                a "reponse" dict for API reponse
                    a "product usage" dict for daily usage statistic of a product
                        a "daily usage" dict for usage amount per day
            
            Logic:
                If the period of days>1, then 
                    avg_amount = average (usage amount / days)
                    for each day in the period            
                        if that date exists in dict, then add this usage amount to that date
                        otherwise, create a key in dict named after the date, and then assign the usage amount 
                If the period of days=1, then 
                    if that date exists in dict, then add this usage amount to that date
                    otherwise, create a key in dict named after the date, and then assign the usage amount
